Midnight-Cloud
==============

This is a project I started in 2011, while I was attending high school. I had the interest in developing an rpg, for the

gnu/linux environment. What I ended up writing was a fairly standard rpg, with some classic gameplay. It also integrated

various creative commons works that can be found across the internet.


I am currently not developing this application further in any static time frame. I may commit a change or two every once in

awhile, but for the most part I have moved on to other projects that I have taken a big interest in. At the same time, the

knowledge I have now is much more advanced than what I knew when I first started developing this application, so this code

is very difficult to navigate.


I will not be taking any commits, however feel free to fork this project if you so desire.
